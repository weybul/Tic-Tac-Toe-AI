# Tic-Tac-Toe-AI
after creatin a rather less complicated version of tic tic toe i went straight back to free code camp's implementation of the same project it seemed hard and for a long time i felt
i was only being able to remember the syntax and not actually the core concepts but i kept at it it took days and i would write code for it each day multiple times a day untill i
completed the project.
the most difficulty i had was with how the board was being printed the instructor said that it dint really add much to the logic of the game and u just need to b able to print it.
i would chat gpt for each line i dint undestand, againkept og repeating myself writing the program.
the minimax algorithm part was another step up since untill now i had only learnt the basics and not things like algorithms n stuff but since it dint require writing a lot of code
for it it dint take much time to go through
over all i felt good for persisting with something i really felt was above my level for the time and i was able to complete it
